                    <h1>return</h1>

<p>A cowboy rides out in the morning on his horse, and returns in the evening. A full day is done. What is he thinking about? What is going on? Who is he? We are only given snapshots. Every day he does it again.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening, “Do it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them.&quot;<br/>- G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy</p></blockquote>

<h2>What I want to achieve</h2>

<ul><li><p>To lift the labour of drawing each time I want to make a comic. Drawing has a place in cartoon humour, but I think <a href="https://www.quantz.com/">Ryan North&#39;s brilliant dinosaur comics</a> has proven that you don&#39;t have to draw a new composition every single time time to make a good gag comic.</p></li><li><p>To apply constraints to the format, to generate creativity within the constraints and to lower the hurdles to a finished project.</p></li><li><p>I think there is a type of humour that comes out of repetition, and that gag cartoons have the necessary components to draw it out well. Whether or not <em>I</em> can do this is yet to be seen.</p></li></ul>
