# return

A cowboy rides out in the morning on his horse, and returns in the evening. A full day is done. What is he thinking about? What is going on? Who is he? We are only given snapshots. Every day he does it again.

## why
- I thought this would be funny
- I like to draw but it takes me ages
- I think the accumulation of daily rituals is interesting, and useful to observe
- I think cowboys are cool
- Overthinking simple premises feels like a well trod yet nonetheless fruitful comedic path
