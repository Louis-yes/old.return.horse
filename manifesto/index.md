# return

A cowboy rides out in the morning on his horse, and returns in the evening. A full day is done. What is he thinking about? What is going on? Who is he? We are only given snapshots. Every day he does it again.

> "It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening, “Do it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them."  
> - G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy

## What I want to achieve

- To lift the labour of drawing each time I want to make a comic. Drawing has a place in cartoon humour, but I think [Ryan North's brilliant dinosaur comics](https://www.quantz.com/) has proven that you don't have to draw a new composition every single time time to make a good gag comic.

- To apply constraints to the format, to generate creativity within the constraints and to lower the hurdles to a finished project.

- I think there is a type of humour that comes out of repetition, and that gag cartoons have the necessary components to draw it out well. Whether or not *I* can do this is yet to be seen.
