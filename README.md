# return.horse

A cowboy rides out in the morning on his horse, and returns in the evening. A full day is done.

What is he thinking about? What is going on? Who is he? We are only given snapshots. Every day he does it again.

return.horse is a webcomic embracing repetition and ritual.  
The sun rises, rides about the sky, and returns.

Not beating a dead horse, but riding a live one through the desert.
