# Return
A cowboy rides out in the morning on his horse, and returns in the evening. A full day is done. What is he thinking about? What is going on? Who is he? We are only given snapshots. Every day he does it again.

"It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening, “Do it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them." - G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy

# What I want to achieve
- To lift the labour of drawing each time I want to make a comic. Drawing has a place in humour, but I think [Dinosaur Comics] ( https://www.quantz.com ) has proven that you don't have to draw a new composition every single time time to make a good gag comic.  
- To apply constraints to the format, to generate creativity within the constraints and to lower the hurdles to a finished project.
- I think there is a type of humour that comes out of repetition, and that gag cartoons have the necessary components to draw it out well. Whether or not *I* can do this is yet to be seen.

# The Plan
3D model the horse and the cowboy, based off of the wee sketch
This will be the base upon which I build.
Have some fun, look at some inspo. Make something I can be proud of, and something I can extend and modify easily. My [bee comic] and my [fruit comic] felt really good. This is an opportunity to learn and practice more 3D.

This will be one of the hardest bits. Then we can aim for 5 weeks, 10 a week? It will be important to do them in blocks, to have it develop with time, and so I can make more concepts than I use, and maybe scrape them later

- Make 50 comics
- This will be a book of 100 pages + intro/outro
- Automate them to post to a site and to instagram
